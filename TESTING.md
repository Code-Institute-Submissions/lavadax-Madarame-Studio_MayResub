## Validation

1. HTML: 
    + All pages were noted to have have unnecessary type attributes in js script tags, which while unnecessary won't do any harm.
    + All pages allso mentioned use of a duplicate ID (user-options) which was fixed by adding "mobile-" to the mobile user-options.

2. CSS:
    + All files mentioned vendor extensions, which are used in an inclusive way, and base.css had 1 rul giving the same color for background and border, which was a stylistic choice.

3. Javascript:
    + There were some missing semicolons in most files, and JSHint didn't like that Stripe was used, but this works as intended as it's code from Stripe's end.
    + A few variables were also instantiated with var, which I changed to let to fit in with the rest of the code. This did require me to instantiate the variables at a higher level to have the correct level of access.

4. Python:
    + As I kept a close eye on this throughout production, all the trailing spaces and line too long errors were dealt with before testing.
    + The only issues remaining are in autogenerated files, and 4 line too long errors in settings.py, which are the password validators.

## Testing User Stories

### First Time Visitor goals  
  
1. As a new user, I want to easily understand the purpose of the site.
    + When opening the main page, the user is greeted with the latest additions to the site, as well as having prices visible and having a basket icon in the top-right corner of the screen.
2. As a new user, I want to be able to easily navigate the site and access the content it provides.
    + The navigational elements on the page have a clear purpose and help guide he user to the required pages.
3. As a new user, I want to easily find where to sign up for an account.
    + The account button is clearly identifiable on all pages of the site, allowing the user to sign up at a time of their choosing.
4. As a new user, I want to find product reviews.
    + The site currently does not support individual reviews, however products do have a rating which is visible on the products overview, as well as the product details page.

### Returning Visitor Goals

1. As a returning user, I want to easily log into my account.
    + The account button is clearly identifiable on all pages of the site, allowing the user to log in at a time of their choosing.
2. As a returning user, I want to be able to locate my order history and check the status of my pending orders.
    + When logged in, the user can look through their order history and open each individual order.
    + Alternatively, without being logged in, the user can search for a specific order number to open the order.
3. As a returning user, I want to leave reviews for products that I purchased before.
    + Unfortunately the site does not support leaving reviews currently, however this is on of the future plans.
